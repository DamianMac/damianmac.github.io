Inspired by [Roll Call AMS](https://twitter.com/rollcallams), Roll Call BNE is a bunch ride for the Brisbane Tech scene.

Open to anybody in the Brisbane tech industry who rides road bikes, we do a monthly [River Loop](https://www.strava.com/routes/10781339) at a gentle pace. We start and finish in Southbank, of course leaving time for coffee.

We're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rollcallbne) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rollcallbne) (both @rollcallbne) for the latest info and pics!

We leave on the first Thursday of the month from [Espresso Garage](https://goo.gl/maps/UqUvD2c1gU72) in Southbank at 5:30am. We're back in South Brisbane for a coffee around 6:30.
