I am an experienced software architect, developer, trainer, and agile engineering consultant.

I've been in tech for nearly 20 years and in that time I've designed software architecture for companies of all sizes, been a CTO for early stage startups, developed and run high profile and high traffic websites, as well as mentored and trained hundreds of developers.

Throughout this time I've developed deep expertise on the architectural patterns, engineering techniques, and team dynamics needed to make successful software.

I've got a particular interest in what I call Agile Engineering, which is a combination of all of the above. It's architectural patterns (such as microservices and Service Oriented Architecture), engineering practices such as TDD, automation engineering, and agile principles to help teams build the right thing and build it quickly.
