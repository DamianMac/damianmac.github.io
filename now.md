I live in Brisbane, Australia. It's a great city for a young family, has fantastic weather, good cycling, and the tech scene is getting better by the day.

Here's what I'm focusing on now (last updated August 2017).

**Work** - Actually this one isn't announced just yet.

**Family** - My kids are currently 10 and 12, and both have a lot going on in their lives. Trying to be available for as many of their activities as possible. Currently that's a whole bunch of AFL (Australian Football) and dance

**Stack Mechanics** With a [couple of friends](/articles/introducing-stack-mechanics) I've just launched [Stack Mechanics](https://stackmechanics.com/). We aim to offer the best deep dive, workshop training in .NET architeture and Microservices.

**Cycling** - I love cycling, it's a massive passion, stress relief, and my primary exersize. I sometimes struggle with consistency, but I'm almost back at race fitness.


I'm also available for [speaking gigs](/speaking/) (although I've not been focusing on that lately), and developer mentoring. 

If you'd like to chat about any of these things, send me an email to blog at damianm.com.


*The Now page is a fantastic idea from [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/) and starting to [be a thing](http://nownownow.com/).*
