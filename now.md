I live in Brisbane, Australia. It's a great city for a young family, has fantastic weather, good cycling, and the tech scene is getting better by the day.

Here's what I'm focusing on now (last updated November 2015).

**Family** - My kids are currently 8 and 10, and both have a lot going on in their lives. Trying to be available for as many of their activities as possible.

**Tatts Group** - I've just started a new role with the [Tatts Group](http://www.tattsgroup.com/) as an Engineering Manager. Tatts have started down the path of a large agile transformation and I'm helping that happen. 

**Cycling** - After a year of being sick I'm coming back into fitness and training hard to be more competitive in races. 

**Yoga** - Something I've dabbled in that I've started doing more of. Currently trying to practice at least 3 or 4 times a week.

**Building things** - I'm picking up a couple of neglected personal projects that may one day turn into something good.


I'm also available for [speaking gigs](/speaking/) (although I've not been focusing on that lately), and developer mentoring. 

If you'd like to chat about any of these things, send me an email to blog at damianm.com.


*The Now page is a fantastic idea from [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/) and starting to [be a thing](http://nownownow.com/).*
