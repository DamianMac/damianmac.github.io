Inspired by [Roll Call AMS](https://twitter.com/rollcallams), Roll Call BNE is a bunch ride for the Brisbane Tech scene.

Open to anybody in the Brisbane tech industry who rides road bikes, we do a monthly River Loop at a gentle pace. We start and finish in Southbank, of course leaving time for coffee.

Info on the next ride will be on Twitter [@rollcallbne](https://twitter.com/rollcallbne).
