So it’s probably about time I came out of hiding and talked about what I’m up to.

I’ve joined [DCC Jobs](https://www.dccjobs.com/) as the CTO. DCC  essentially is a job board for women. We screen companies for criteria based on their policies so we only advertise companies that are good places to work for women.

It’s an exciting company, founded by two friends and ex-colleagues of mine, and we’re making a difference.

Which brings me to how I got here.

I took up a role at Tatts Group at the beginning of 2016. Tatts were 2 years into an agile transformation and needed experience technical leadership so I joined as an Engineering Manager for the Lotteries division.

It was good for a while but as the merger with Tabcorp started to loom closer it became harder to get anything done. I believe agility comes from giving people responsibility and ownership and allowing them to make mistakes. 

So in a large enterprise with entire teams dedicated to functions that I see as part of a day to day role of a senior developer, I was a loud, lone voice.

Not a good fit for me, I was frustrated and burnt out, not able to make the change I wanted.

So at the end of November 2017 I finished up there.

As fate would have it, this was about the time [Gemma](https://twitter.com/gemllo) got in touch to talk about her plans and vision for the future of DCC, and the need to build a technical team.

So here I am.

I’m not going to go into too much detail about what I’m working on yet, but I have to say I’m having a blast. We’re in full startup mode and I’ve written more code in the last 6 weeks than in a long time. I’m playing with a whole bunch of new tech and the learning curve has been very steep. It’s amazing what can change when you spend 2 years in essentially a management role.

A company in the stage we’re in is a fascinating mix of priorities. Every day is a tradeoff between what you can do to benefit the company and customers TODAY vs things you should do to benefit you in 3 months time. 

It’s really nice to be moving fast again, building things, and living the hustle.

I’ve got a bit more to say these days, especially on the tech front, so hopefully I’ll find the headspace to write my thoughts down.
