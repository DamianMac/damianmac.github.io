Thanks for stopping by!



I am a technologist, [CTO](/articles/new-year-new-career), [cyclist](/cycling), semi ex-musician and father of two living in Brisbane Australia.

I’ve made technology my career for over fifteen years. I’ve spent a lot of time working in web development agencies, as a Solutions Architect working in the digial media management and content delivery field, a stint in the non profit world, a whole lot of consulting, CTO of [Octopus Deploy](http://octopusdeploy.com/), change agent in a big enterprise, and currently back in startup land.

I'm also the co-founder of [Stack Mechanics](https://stackmechanics.com/), offering deep dive .NET architecture and Microservices training.

Getting in Touch
-------

I can be found all over the web, the social icons on the left are a good start. GitHub for the code, Linkedin for the professional networking, Twitter for the sorts of random that Twitter is perfect for and Instagram is mainly pictures of bikes, kids and coffees (not necessarily in that order, but sometimes!)

If none of those options are right. You can always send an email to blog at damianm.com
