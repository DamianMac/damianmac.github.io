Thanks for stopping by!


I am a technologist, [cyclist](/cycling), semi ex-musician and father of two. I currently live in Brisbane, Australia. After spending most of my life in Sydney, we moved north in October 2009.


I’ve been made technology my career for over fifteen years. I’ve spent a lot of time working in web development agencies, as a Solutions Architect working in the digial media management and content delivery field, a stint in the non profit world, independent consultant and nearly 6 years as a Principal Consultant with [Readify](http://www.readify.net/).

In 2014 I took on the role as CTO with [Octopus Deploy](http://octopusdeploy.com/) to help grow the product and the team behind it.

Getting in Touch
-------

I can be found all over the web, the social icons on the left are a good start. GitHub for the code, Linkedin for the professional networking, Twitter for the sorts of random that Twitter is perfect for and Instagram is mainly pictures of bikes, kids and coffees (not necessarily in that order, but sometimes!)

If none of those options are right. You can always send an email to blog at damianm.com
