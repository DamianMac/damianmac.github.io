Personal
--------

I am a technologist, cyclist, musician and father of two. I currently live in Brisbane, Australia. After spending most of my life in Sydney, we moved north in October 2009.


Professional
------------

I’ve been made technology my career for over twelve years. I’ve spent a lot of time working in web development agencies, a Solutions Architect working in the digial media management and content delivery field, a stint in the non profit world, independant consultant and currently a Principal Consultant with [Readify](http://www.readify.net/).

My work currently involves a lot of technical and architecture strategy at a CIO and CTO level, I also do a lot of work with teams. Technical mentoring, agile coaching and development process and practice consulting. As well as the important human aspects of software development I work a lot on the engineering practices required to make agile work well such as TDD, continuous integration and deployment and automation.

I've been on Twitter for a while now, back in early 2007 it was very much the virtual watercooler and less the vehicle for serious personal branding that many people use it for today. Follow me by all means, but expect much more of the former and less of the latter.

If we've worked together at all or come across each other at any industry type events feel free to connect on LinkedIn. I find it a handy way of keeping a track of where people are working, a good source of industry gossip too.
