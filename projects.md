# Nimbus

[Nimbus][] is a .NET API for the Azure Service Bus. It brings a programming model similar to [MassTransit][] or [NServiceBus][] to Azure. It's a collaboration between [Andrew Harcourt][] and myself with input from some of our other Readify colleagues. It started as something we needed for some of our projects, but we decided pretty early to open source it and try to make it the default option for doing messaging driven applications on Azure.

# Cycling Sites

I created and run a number of online communities for cyclists. I started [Sydney Cyclist][] in 2007, [Melbourne Cyclist][] came soon after I and launched [Brisbane Cyclist][] a few months after moving to Brisbane in late 2009.
